PRESENTATION
============

What does `Ner'zhul' mean?
----------------------------

Ner'zhul is the current Lish version codename.  This is why you can sometime
read `Lish Ner'zhul' throughout the software inline documentation.  Ner'zhul
originally comes from the name of the Lich King in the Warcraft game series.


FEATURES
========

Lish supports nearly all standard Bash-like commands. Il alsa includes some
features like shared history between each executing instance of the shell.


Is it useable?
--------------

Yes, it is. But since it doesn't support autocompletion, keyboard arrows,
etc., it isn't not sutable for everyday use.


Can the prompt be customized?
-----------------------------

Yes, it is the same $PS1 environment variable that is a template for the
prompt, but it doesn't support all Bash escape sequences though.
